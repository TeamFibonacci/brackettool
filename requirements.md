It solves the problem of score keepers having to keep track of scores in their head or on paper, 
which can be messy and unreliable. You can save a lot of time and effort with our product,

Data Flow
	The score keeper using the app will input each player in the game.  
  From there, the user will go to the next page where they can then update points for each player.  
  The user will then be presented with a new bracket representing the results of that input.  
  When the user completes the final bracket, results will be tabulated and various data will be returned to the user.
