We will create a tiered bracket roster that will also take the user to a secondary page. When they reach the 2nd page, it will have a life counter, when on life reaches 0. Two tools solves the issue of keeping track of tournament bracketing and health counters. Our MVP is that the user can input their name, then use the counter to track life lost and gained. Once on competitor dies it will show their stats to them asa graph then take them back to the brcket page.
