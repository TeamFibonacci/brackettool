User Stories

We will create a tiered bracket roster that will also take the user to a secondary page. When they reach the 2nd page, it will have a life counter, when on life reaches 0. Two tools solves the issue of keeping track of tournament bracketing and health counters. Our MVP is that the user can input their name, then use the counter to track life lost and gained. Once on competitor dies it will show their stats to them asa graph then take them back to the brcket page.

Score tracker  -1 to 2 Days
As a score keeper, I would like to be able to keep track of my score along with my adversaries scores to keep track of game progress, so that my score keeper can accurately track the overall scores.Make buttons to increase or decrease scores.If I can select a number for each player and receive an output, that will be sufficient.

Bracket -4 hours
As a score keeper, I would like to view game progress as a bracket where I can see the standing of each of my players, so that we can keep an eye on the over all status.I would like you to display brackets with buttons next to them that allows me to move to the score keeping page.If I have a functional button to move between pages, that will be sufficient.

Graph -4 hours
As a score keeper, I would like to display a graph to my fellow players after the game is tabulated, so that my users have a better visual of the game results.Please populate a graph after the game information is entered showing user stats and other information.If I have a graph after the game is complete, or upon pressing a specific button, that will be sufficient.

Beautiful layout -1 to 2 hours

Special Effects 5-6 hours
As a user, I would like to experience special effects when I click buttons and maybe even when I traverse pages.Please try to include a sound or visual effect when my user interacts with the page, so that they will have a more exciting experience.If I can click on a page element and it does anything more than it’s standard function, that will be sufficient.
